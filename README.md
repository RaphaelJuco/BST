# BST
Binary Search Tree (BST) program in C++

That has functions that allows us to 
1) load the BST from a dataset in the order they exist in the dataset
2) find the smallest branch height
3) find the highest branch height
4) find the number of nodes in the tree
5) determine if the tree is balanced
6) determine if the tree is complete
